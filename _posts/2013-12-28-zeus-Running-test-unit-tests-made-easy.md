In **Rails 3.2**, there are predefined tasks to run Test::Unit tests like `rake test:units`, `rake test:functionals` etc. But when you are developing, you may need to run a single test or tests from a file. None of the rake tasks provide this in Rails 3.2.

I like to show you how you can do this with [zeus](https://github.com/burke/zeus).

# What's this zeus?
Zeus is rails application preloader. It preload your rails environment so that you run rake tasks, server and console with in 1-2 seconds. It reloads itself when ever you make any changes to initializers or do a bundle. It will saves you from rails booting.

`zeus test` is coupled with some handy hacks which will let you run your tests easily. You can run all tests in a file or a single test.

# Run tests in a single file
You can run tests from a single file by just passing the file path to `zeus test`
{% highlight sh %}
zeus test test/functional/some_test.rb
{% endhighlight %}


# Run a single test
Consider this as your test case.

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
# test/functional/some_controller_test.rb
class SomeControllerTest < ActionController::TestCase
  def setup

  end

  test 'should create' do
    # your test
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Think that in the above case you need to run only **should create**. With zeus there are multiple ways to run single test.

# \#1
You can use pass the test case as underscored and prepend with **test_** which makes **test\_should\_create** and pass to `-n` option.

{% highlight sh %}
zeus test test/functional/some_controller_test.rb -n test_should_create
{% endhighlight %}

# \#2

Another similar method is passing the test case in double quotes to `-n` option. Don't forget to prepend **test** before test case.
{% highlight sh %}
zeus test test/functional/some_controller_test.rb -n "test should create"
{% endhighlight %}

# \#3

The third method felt more comfortable for me. Just append **:\<line_no of test case\>** to the file path.
{% highlight sh %}
zeus test test/functional/some_controller_test.rb:7
{% endhighlight %}

Here **7** is the line number of `test "should create"`.

In **Rails 4**, you can pass the filename to the rake tasks and **Rails 4.1** will ship with [spring](https://github.com/jonleighton/spring) preloader. But still I believe zeus will be my favorite to run tests.

Happy testing.
