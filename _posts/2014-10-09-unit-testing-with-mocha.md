In the [Kerala JS: September meetup](http://keralajs.org/2014/09/24/september-meetup), I gave a talk on Unit Testing with Mocha.
My primary goal of this talk was to give a introduction to testing in JavaScript.

The slides of my talk are available below

The sinppet I used to show the testing JS in browser is available as JsBin.

You can also take a look at [Testing jQuery ajax with mocha and sinon](http://blog.revathskumar.com/2013/03/testing-jquery-ajax-with-mocha-and-sinon.html) in which I explained how to test a Ajax functionality using Sinon.
