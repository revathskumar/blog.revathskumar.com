If your team member is 

* waiting for your review on his/her pull request 
* waiting for data modeling
* waiting for suggestion on the approach

your priority should be on those, realizing someone is blocked on you and he/she can't work on anything 
unless we unblock them.

So instead of moving these things into a list saying will do in while, try to finish then and there.
Don't schedule these meetings into the end of day. It just waste the time and energy of your peer without any productivity.

Now consider not just one person but the whole team is blocked!
