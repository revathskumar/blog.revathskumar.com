Environment variables are really handy to pass value to a process. It really helps you to easily set the environment like development or production or pass a port number to use, so you don't want change the code to set a temporarily value.

You can read the environment variables in nodejs using

```js
process.env.VARIABLE_NAME
```

For example if you want to pass the port number, you can use

```js
var port = process.env.PORT || 9000;
```

so it will take `9000` as the default port and if you want change the port temporarily, you can run like

```sh
PORT=9002 node app.js
```

Hope that helped you.
