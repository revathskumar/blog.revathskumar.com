Last sunday, I attended [Barcamp Kerala](http://barcampkerala.org/) and given a talk to introduce [KeralaJS](http://keralajs.org/) and [KeralaRuby](http://krug.github.io/) to fellow attendees.

I thought of giving an introduction to these communities and inspire some people by listing some of the advantages I got by being a part of these communities. The main motive of my talk was to build a KeralaJS and KeralaRuby communities in Trivandrum.

The talk was divided into 3 main parts,

1. Why we need meetups.
2. How it Helped me.
3. My Idea about a meetup.

In the section, "My idea about meetup" I thought of correcting some misconseption about meetups.

If you were there, please send me a feedback on my talk.
