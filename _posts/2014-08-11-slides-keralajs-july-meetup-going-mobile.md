In our [KeralaJS](http://keralajs.org) July meetup, I given a talk on things I learned on responsive design while we ([whatznear](https://whatznear.com)) went mobile with our responsive design.

In summary, Here is the things I discussed in my talk

# Making `<table>` responsive
I already wrote a detailed post on [`<table>` in responsive design](/2014/07/css-table-in-responsive-design.html)

# Advantage of using input types
While going mobile its a must to use appropriate input types, like tel, number, email etc, which will help to show appropriate keyboards on mobile.

# Useful Tools
* Chrome Devtools
* [MIH Tool](http://www.iunbug.com/mihtool) for iOS devise
