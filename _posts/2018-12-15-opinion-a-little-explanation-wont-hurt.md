In daily standup, I hear

* Today, I'm working on this api
* Today, I'm working on this design

this happens for couple of days from the sprint started or sometimes the whole sprint.

Instead lets practice with little bit explanation like

* I started working with CREATE of this api.
* I finished UPDATE of this api and started with DELETE
* I had to work on the **unexpected** thing and resumed and continued with DELETE of api.

Standup, should be shorter without losing its purpose. `I am working on this api` kind of update repeatedly
defeat its purpose.

A little detail/explanation won't hurt.
