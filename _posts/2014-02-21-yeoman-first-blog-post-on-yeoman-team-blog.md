Allo' Allo'

I am happy that last week, my first blog post got published on [Yeoman team blog](http://yeoman.io/blog). First I drafted the same to publish over here, then thought of contibuting to our team blog. 

Thanks to [Eddie Monge](https://github.com/eddiemonge) for effort to proofread and editing the post for clarity.
