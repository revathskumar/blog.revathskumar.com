<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I always get frustrated while installing readline package for rvm and need a bunch of googling for successful installation. So I thought of no more googling for this stuff and I just noted step by step procedures for doing it with ease. This post assumes that you already setup rvm and ruby on your workstations and using&nbsp;Ubuntu.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b><u>The Prerequisites</u></b></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You need to install the following packages as prerequisites for readline package. Choose the&nbsp;prerequisites according to the Ubuntu version.<br /><br /><b>Ubuntu 11.04</b><br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>libncurses5-dev</li><li>libreadline5-dev&nbsp;</li></ul>use the following command to install those prerequisites  <br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1985584.js?file=prerequisites-1104.sh"></script><b>Ubuntu 11.10</b><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you are using ubuntu 11.10 and rvm 1.10.0 then try using <b>rvm requirements</b> command to find all the dependencies. For readline we require only the two packages which are listed below.<br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>libreadline-gplv2-dev</li><li>lib64readline-gplv2-dev&nbsp;</li></ul>use the following command to install those prerequisites <br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1985584.js?file=prerequisites-1110.sh"></script><b>Common for both Ubuntu 11.10 and Ubuntu 11.04</b><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ncurses-dev package is common for both Ubuntu 11.04 and 11.10.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1985584.js?file=prerequisites-common.sh"></script> <span style="font-size: large;"><b><u>Installing readline</u></b></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now the prerequisites are over. Now we can install the readline package<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1985584.js?file=install.sh"></script> <span style="font-size: large;"><b><u>Configuring readline</u></b></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Use the following commands to configure readline.
