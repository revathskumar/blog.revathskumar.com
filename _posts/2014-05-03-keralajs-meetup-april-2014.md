Last saturday(2014-04-26), we had our 5th [KeralaJS](http://keralajs.org/2014/04/23/keralajs-meetup-april-2014) meetup at [Toobler](http://toobler.com/). We started our meetup with introduction to KeralaJS for our new members. Then moved to live coding session by [Deepak Kumar](https://twitter.com/42races) on "Introduction to [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/)". The session continued till 4, explaining how to get started with Ember and various features of it.

After the coding session, we went for a networking break for 20 minutes and back for my talk on [Maria.js](https://github.com/petermichaux/maria). I started it with explaing classic MVC and why JavaScript frameworks are not actual MVC (Classic). I explained how Model 2 pattern got confused with MVC and ignited a discussion on MVC and patterns.

Our last talk was by [Praseed Pai](http://praseedp.blogspot.in/) and he about the JavaScript port of his compiler, "[Slang](http://slangfordotnet.codeplex.com/)". He also showed us running it on Google chrome. He actually inspired us to write a compiler by saying "Writing a compiler now a days are really easy". 

After that we wind up our 5th meetup by listing our plans for next meetup. Before I finish I would like to thank Toobler again for hosting us a wonderful meetup.

Thanks
