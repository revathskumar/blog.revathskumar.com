Consider you have two tables products and Oraganisation, where product belongs
to a particular organisation.

    Product                   Organisation
      - id                      - id
      - name                    - name
      - organisation_id         - description


So when you want to get the organisation name,  which the product belongs to then 
you say,

{% highlight ruby %}
 # Please note that thoughtout this post I will be refereing to `@product` which 
 # assumed as object of Product model.
@product.organisation.name
{% endhighlight %}


But according to "Rails Anti-patterns" more than one dot notation in a statement  is an example of anti pattern.

# Normal fix

So How we can fix it, In Product model write a instance method `organisation_name`
just like below.

{% highlight ruby %}
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :organisation

  def organisation_name
    organisation.name
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}


# Using delegate

Writing methods for all the properties is a tedious task, Instead of that we can use [delegate](http://apidock.com/rails/Module/delegate) in rails.

You can simply use below code instead of writing a method `organisation_name`.

{% highlight ruby %}
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :organisation

  delegate :name, to: :organisation, prefix: true
end
{% endhighlight %}

Now you can use `@product.organisation_name` to instead of `@product.organisation.name`.

You can pass method name and target model/object via `:to` option. Here `:prefix` option determine whether the method name should prepend with object name or not. 

If you wanna custom prefix, then

{% highlight ruby %}
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :organisation

  delegate :name, to: :organisation, prefix: :org
end
{% endhighlight %}

Now you can use  as `@product.org_name`
