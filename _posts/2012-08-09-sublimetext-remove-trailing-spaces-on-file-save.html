<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I hate to have trailing spaces in my git codebase. Since I was an netbeans user before, there was an option to remove trailing spaces; but manually we need to command on each file. But after switching into SublimeText I searched for such option in the menu, but didn't find.<br /><br />SublimeText really surprised me by giving much more easiler way to trim the trailing spaces. In sublime text we &nbsp;don't need to&nbsp;manually use the option. They are intelligent enough to do this before each time we save the file.<br /><br />We need to manually enable the option in user settings, since they are disabled by default. Here is how we can enable it.<br /><br />Goto <b>Preferences -&gt; Settings - User</b><br /><br />Add the below line into the file, in between the curly braces ({})<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/3301707.js?file=remove-space.json"></script> Now save it. You are done.<br />Now your user specific preferences &nbsp;file will look something like this,provided if you didn't set any other user specific prefences ;)<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/3301707.js?file=final.json"></script> <b>Screencast </b><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-s3yX_46lzpM/UCNnkJZCeTI/AAAAAAAAGas/LiF2Pu1KVA0/s800/sublime-trailing-space.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-s3yX_46lzpM/UCNnkJZCeTI/AAAAAAAAGas/LiF2Pu1KVA0/s400/sublime-trailing-space.gif" width="400" /></a></div></div>
