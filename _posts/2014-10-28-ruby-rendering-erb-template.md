I never used [ERB](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.4/libdoc/erb/rdoc/ERB.html) outside Rails or without [tilt](http://github.com/rtomayko/tilt). So while I
was working with a bare rack app, I though I should try our ERB directly and checkout its api.

So I taken a look into ERB Class just enought to render a template, nothing much detail. Here is the syntax for ERB constructor,

```ruby
ERB.new(template_string, safe_eval=nil, trim_mode=nil, outvar='_erbout')
```

# Using Sting template
Here is the simple example, for rendering a string template. Since we didn't specify the `outvar` the result method will return the rendered html.

```ruby
name = "Whatznear";
ERB.new("<h1>Hello ERB World!! </h1><h3><%= name %></h3>").result(binding)
```

Hope you noticed that we are passing `binding` to result method. binding gives the context in which the template to be evaluated, so they can replace the correct variables with its values.

If you like look into binding in details, you can check the [ruby doc for Binding](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.4/Binding.html). The above snippet will result in 

```html
<h1>Hello ERB World!! </h1><h3>Whatznear</h3>
```


# Using template file
If you want to render a template from file, you just need to read the content of file and pass to ERB constructor.

```ruby
require "erb"

class Basicerb

  def initialize name
    @name = name
    @template = File.read('./index.erb')
  end

  def render
    ERB.new(@template).result( binding )
  end
end
```

```erb
<%# index.erb %>
<h1>Hello ERB World!! </h1><h3><%= @name %></h3>
```
Here, in the `@name`, an instance variable because we are passing the context of `Basicerb` object to `result` method.

If you want to store the rendered html into another instance variable you can the variable as `outvar`.


```ruby
require "erb"

class Basicerb
  attr_reader :html

  def initialize name
    @name = name
    @template = File.read('./index.erb')
  end

  def render
    ERB.new(@template, 0, "", "@html").result( binding )
  end
end
```

# Using layout and view template
The most confusing things was rendering some erb inside an layout. Here is the `layout.rb`

```erb
<div class="jumbotron">
    <%= yield %>
</div>
```

and we use the above `index.erb` as view.

```ruby
require "erb"

class Basicerb
  def initialize name
    @name = name
    @layout = File.read('./layout.erb')
    @template = File.read('./index.erb')
  end

  def render
    templates = [@template, @layout]
    templates.inject(nil) do | prev, temp |
      _render(temp) { prev }
    end
  end

  def _render temp
    ERB.new(temp).result( binding )
  end
end
```

Lets break it down how it works, The [Enumerable#inject](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.4/Enumerable.html#method-i-inject) will accept a value and a block. The block will be executed for every element and value will be taken as first value. So in this case, in the first iteration, `prev` will be nil and temp will be the `@template` (view) string and pass it to `_render` method. Since this `@template` doesn't have a `yield` it just render the string as before. 

In the second iteration, the `prev` will be rendered html of `@template` and `temp` will be `@layout`. Then these values will be passed to `_render`. Now while rendering layout it have a `yield` method which will be replaced by rendered html of `@template`. And finaly the `render` method will return 

```html
<div class="jumbotron">
  <h1>Hello ERB World!! </h1><h3>Whatznear</h3>
</div>
```
