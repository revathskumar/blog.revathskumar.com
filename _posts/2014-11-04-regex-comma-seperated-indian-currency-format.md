Recently, I got a request to show prices in comma seperated format on [whatznear.com](http://whatznear.com). Since we are using rails, it have a handy method to do [number\_to\_currency](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/NumberHelper.html#method-i-number_to_currency), but unfortunately that was not enough because it follow US system of seperation with thousands. My requirement was to show prices in Indian system of seperation with hundreds.

```ruby
450,500 # US system
4,50,500 # Indian System
```

So I dropped a mail to [Kerala Ruby Users Groups](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/kerala-ruby-users-group/9-TjkhSTspc/R-NIwr9XuxwJ) and [Hari Sankar](http://csnipp.com/coderhs) replied with a [regular expression](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/kerala-ruby-users-group/9-TjkhSTspc/10ywX41mZiUJ) from his snippet collection.

```ruby
price.to_s.gsub(/(\d+?)(?=(\d\d)+(\d)(?!\d))(\.\d+)?/, "\\1,")
```

The above regex worked fine for me, but I was curious to know how it works. So I started digging into regex documentation. I am gonna explain, what I understand about the regex.

[![Regex groups explained](http://i653.photobucket.com/albums/uu253/revathskumar/Coderepo/2014/11/Screenshotfrom2014-11-02223852_zpsaf17908a.png)](http://www.regexper.com/#%2F\(%5Cd%2B%3F\)\(%3F%3D\(%5Cd%5Cd\)%2B\(%5Cd\)\(%3F!%5Cd\)\)\(%5C.%5Cd%2B\)%3F%2F)

## Group 1 `(\d+?)`

Let look into group 1 ie., `(\d+?)` which says digit should be matched as often as possible. I think there is nothing much confusing here except the tailing `?`. The question mark tells the regex engine, "**preceding token zero times or once**". A `?` after `+` makes it [lazy](http://www.regular-expressions.info/repeat.html#lazy) and return as soon as the first match.

##  positive lookahead `(?=(\d\d)+(\d)(?!\d))`

The Grouping start with `?=` means its a positive lookahead and the previously captured match (matched by group 1) should follow match of this group. Whatever this Group 2 matches won't expand the match of Group 1.

In order to match this group, 2 digits should be found at least once (`(\d\d)+`), followed by a digit (`(\d)`) and non digit. 

`(?!\d)` is a [negative lookahead](http://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html) which succeeds when the regex inside lookahead fails. This helps to filter out last 3 digits of a number.


## How Group 1 & positive lookahead works together `(\d+?)(?=(\d\d)+(\d)(?!\d))`

When the group 1 and positive lookahead works together, for the first match there should be
a digit followed by at least 1 group of 2 digits, followed by a single digit and non digit.

lets take the number **1234567.00**, as the regex engine always returns the leftmost match,
the first match will be `12` since it is followed by group of 2 digit (twice) (34 & 56) and a digit then a `.` (non digit). The second match will be `34` since it is followed by group of 2 digit (once) (56) and then a `.` (non digit). Then the engine will try to match again but `56` **won't** get a match since it is not followed by the group of 2 digits. So the resulting match will be

The last group `(\.\d+)?` is for floating point.

## String#gsub

Now we have the two matches with first group as `12` and `34` respectively. First group in two matches can be referenced by `\1` since we didn't name the group. So with [String#gsub](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.4/String.html#method-i-gsub) we can replace the content of group 1 with `<content of group1>,`, ie., we can replace `12` with `12,` and `34` with `34,`.

```ruby
# replacing 12 with 12, and 34 with 34,.
.gsub(/(\d+?)(?=(\d\d)+(\d)(?!\d))(\.\d+)?/, "\\1,")
```
we used two backslash `"\\1,"` because we used a double quotes, if you are using single quotes just `'\1,'` will be enough. if you didn't escape the backslash wile using double quotes, ruby will consider `"\1,"` as  unicode 1 `\u0001,`.

Hope this explanation helped.
Thank you.
