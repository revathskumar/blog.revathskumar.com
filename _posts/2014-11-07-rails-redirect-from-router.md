In one of my recent requirements, I need redirect the people/bot landing on an old/deprecated urls need to redirected to either a new page or to our home page. Usually I do such redirecting from the controller, But recently I came to know that we can even redirect from the router itself. 

## Simple redirect

```ruby
match /.*/, to:  redirect('/'), via: :all
```

The above route will match anything and route to homepage. Be cautions to use such routes, and use only in end of your `WhatznearWebApp::Application.routes.draw` block in router file. The routes on top of `draw` block have higher precedence and matched first.

## Redirect with constraints

If you have some constraints for redirects you can use `:constaints` key to impose them.

```ruby
match ":url", to: redirect('/'), via: :all, constraints: { url: /stores-.*/ }
```

In the above route, the request will be redirected to homepage only if the url starts with `stores-`. Make sure you don't use `^`(Regexp anchor characters) to specify `starts with` rails won't accept that.

## Why I am redirecting

If you are thinking of asking me why I am redirecting instead of mapping this to home page, the reasons are

* since the urls are deprecated, I don't want anyone to bookmark this.
* search engine crawlers should know that this url is redirect and should not index as home page.
