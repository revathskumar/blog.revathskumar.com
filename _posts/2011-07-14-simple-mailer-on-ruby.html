Here is the really simple script to mail from ruby. Here i assumed that your system is configured with ruby, all need gems and SMTP.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1083170.js?file=rubymailer.rb"></script><br /><br />Substitute the Sender's email and recipient's email.<br />Don't put any space or other character at the begining of the line inside <i><b>message heredoc</b></i> (ie., don't use indentation in that)<br />Save the script in a file for Eg:rubymailer.rb and run <b> ruby rubymailer.rb</b><br /><br /><br />Happy mailing<br /><br />
