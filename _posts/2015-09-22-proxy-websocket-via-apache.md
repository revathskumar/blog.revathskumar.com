When I connect the websocket from my PHP application, I always wanted to use the same URL of webapp for the websocket connection. I was not happy with seperate url with a port to connect with websockets.

Recently I figured out how to proxy my websocket connection with apache. In order to proxy it, I need to enable `mod_proxy_wstunnel` module in apache.

```sh
sudo a2enmod mod_proxy_wstunnel
```

Next is to specify the endpoint which the websocket will connect, so we can proxy it to our websocket server. This needs to be specified in virtual host using `ProxyPass` directive.

```
ProxyRequests Off
ProxyPass "/ws/"  "ws://localhost:9030/"
ProxyPass "/wss/"  "wss://localhost:9030/"
```

This configuration in my virtual host will proxy my websocket connection to websocket server through apache.

Now I can connect my websocket to the same URL as my webapp.

```js

var connection = new WebSocket('ws://localhost/ws');

```

Now I don't need to specify the port which websocket is running, instead I specify the endpoint.
