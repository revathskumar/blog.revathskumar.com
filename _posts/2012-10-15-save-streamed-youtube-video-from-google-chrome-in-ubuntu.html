<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp; &nbsp; Do you really wanna a script to save the streamed youtube video? Here is it, but there are some conditions. You should stream the video once in your google chrome without&nbsp;buffering. I tried this script &nbsp;on my U<b>buntu with Google chrome</b> and I find it successful. I prefer not to play the video while it streams, because we can't save a video which shown buffering or loading while we playing it.<br /><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Save the script below as a shell script. Please create a folder named flvs in your <b>~/Videos/</b> directory or change the path of <b>OUTPUTDIR</b> to some existing directory.</div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/2719617.js?file=save_vdo.sh"></script> <br /><div>You can execute this script by copy paste this to your terminal and press enter.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/2719617.js?file=execute.sh"></script><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If you are using firefox as browser, I am not sure this script will work even after changing the <b>CACHE</b> directory. I haven't tested this script with firefox or any other Linux distributions. Please feel free to test this on other environments and lemme know whether it works for you. I am awaiting for your response on comments.</div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp; So before I&nbsp;conclude, please keep in mind&nbsp;</div><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>stream your video without&nbsp;buffering</li><li>create or update path of&nbsp;OUTPUTDIR</li><li>make sure you are on Ubuntu with Google chrome</li><li>make sure the path to CACHE is correct</li></ul><div>Thank you</div></div></div>
