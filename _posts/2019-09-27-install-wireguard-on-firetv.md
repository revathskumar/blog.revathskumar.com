[WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) is a moden next gen VPN which utilizes cryptography. 
Since Wireguard is not available on FireTV's app store, we have to sideload the app using adb.

## Enable ADB on FireTV.

First step to side load the app to FireTv is to enable `ADB debugging` and `Apps from unknown sources`.

To do this Goto `Settings -> My FireTV -> Developer Options`

- Choose Option **My FireTV** from Settings

- Choose **Developer Options**

- Turn on **ADB debugging** and **Apps from unknown sources**

![Choose Developer Options]({{ page.image }}){:width="100%"}

## Download Wireguard apk from F-Droid

Next we can download the [wireguard apk][wireguard-fdroid] from F-droid to your system.
Once the download is finished let's connect the system to our FireTV.

```
adb connect <firetv ip>:5555
```

Once the connection is success, we can install the apk.

```
adb install </path/to/wireguard.apk>
```

Done. once the installtion is success you can see wireguard among the other app on fireTV.
Open the wireguard app on fireTV to configure the VPN.
