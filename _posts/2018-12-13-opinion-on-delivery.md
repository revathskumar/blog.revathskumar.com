To ship something, we should first know `what to ship` and why are we shipping this.

Even though we don't know the answer to `why?`, answer to **What?** is a must.    
Consider, we don't know the answer to **What?**. Its like a journey we take without knowing destination.
People we meet in the journey will give different suggestions and we take those.
We travel a lot, put lot of effort and money into it but no use because we don't know where we are going.

Same happens in shipping a software or a module of it. 
Since we haven't frozen the design or the requirements we tend to keep changing things.

**Program Manager** will come with one.  
**Business Analyst** with another opinion.  
Later the **Engineering Manager** with the third one.  

By the end of the sprint, at the time of demo. the question will come

**Is that what we worked for the whole sprint?** 

Nobody want to think about the changes happened to the requirements or to the design.

The problem is clarity on what to deliver and not the efficiency of the developer.
