Rails `remote` is one of the best way to submit a form with ajax. But it is not capable of uploading files using ajax. That's where `remotipart` gem comes into action.

## Add gem to Gemfile

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'remotipart'
```

After adding `remotipart` to `Gemfile` do the `bundle install`.

## Add to javascript manifest

Then you need to require `remotipart` in javascript manifest.

```js
// app/assets/javascripts/application.js

//= require jquery.remotipart 
```

## set `multipart` option for form

As in every form with fileupload, you need to set the `multipart` option. 

```erb
<%= form_for(@upload, remote: true, multipart: true) do |f| %>
    <%= f.file_field :image %>
    <%= f.submit %>
<% end %>
```

Thats it, you don't need any extra configuration for the forms. A [example application](https://github.com/revathskumar/rails-ajax-upload) is available on github.
