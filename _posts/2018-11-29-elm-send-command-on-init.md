In the last post [ELM : pick random item from list][pick_random_item_post] we discussed about finding a random number on a button click.
But that not that intuitive. we should have a placeholder text until the user clicks on the button for the first time. To avoid this we need to send the `FindRandom` Cmd on the init itself.

This post will explain how we can achieve this.

## <a class="anchor" name="single-cmd" href="#single-cmd"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Single Cmd

The `init` function returns a tuple of model and a Cmd. its signature will look like `init : Flags -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )` and since we don't have any `Cmd` to perform there we usually give `Cmd.none`.

```elm
init : Flags -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
init flags =
   ( initialModel, Cmd.none)
```

Just replacing `Cmd.none` with `FindRandom` won't work since `FindRandom` is a `Msg` and as per init type signature it needs `Cmd Msg`.
Thats where the [elm/Task][elm_task] comes in. As per the elm doc a Task can be described as

   asynchronous operations that may fail, like HTTP requests or writing to a database.

In our case we can use this to convert the `Msg` into `Cmd Msg` using [Task.succeed][task_succeed] & [Task.perform][task_perform].

`Task.succeed` will convert the `Msg` into a Task which will `succeed` immediately and the run the task using `Task.perform` and convert into `Cmd` using an `identity` function.

An `identity` function is a function which takes one argument and return the same.

```elm
identity : a -> a
identity a =
   a
```

If you are thinking why `identity` function, it means that what ever the result of the task will be the result of the `Cmd`.

ie., `Task.perform identity` takes the task produced by `Task.succeed FindRandom` and convert into `Cmd msg`.

Thus our `init` function becomes

```elm
init : Flags -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
init flags =
   ( initialModel, Task.succeed FindRandom |> Task.perform identity  )
```

The updated running sample is on [ellie-app][code_snippet]

## <a class="anchor" name="multiple-cmd" href="#multiple-cmd"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Multiple Cmd

Last section we saw how to perform a `Cmd msg` on `init`, but in some cases we might need to perform more than one `Cmd  msg` on `init`.
For this we can use `Cmd.batch` to do this.

```elm
init : Flags -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
init flags =
   ( initialModel, Cmd.batch
                [ Random.generate NewId (Random.int 1000 10000)
                , Task.succeed (AddItem "Setup & provision production server") |> Task.perform identity
                , Task.succeed (AddItem "Setup CI") |> Task.perform identity
                , Task.succeed (AddItem "Setup Project Skeleton") |> Task.perform identity
                  ])
```

The above example is taken from [revathskumar/estimate-helper][estimate_helper_batch]
