[Express.js](http://expressjs.com) is one of the popular web application framework for Node.js. To implement Github authentication [passport](http://passportjs.org/) module seems to really flexible.

To start, register a new application on Github goto [Account > Applications > Register new application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new). This will yield you a client id and client secret for your application which we will use later. While registering new appplication they will ask for a callback url, let it be `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`.

# Install passport
After creating new express.js project install the [passport](https://www.npmjs.org/package/passport) and [passport-github](https://www.npmjs.org/package/passport-github) Strategy.

```sh
npm install passport passport-github --save
```

# Configure passport
To configure, start with require passport and passport-github strategy into your application.

```js
// app.js
var passport = require('passport');
var GithubStrategy = require('passport-github').Strategy;

```

Now initialize the passport middleware with `app.use`. Usually, a freshly baked express.js doesn't use `cookieParse` and `session` middleware so before adding passport middleware add those to your application. You will receive some weird errors if you didn't. Also I recommend to use them in the following order after `app.use(express.methodOverride());`

```js
app.use(express.cookieParser());
app.use(express.session({secret: 'mysecret'}));
app.use(passport.initialize());
app.use(passport.session());

```

# Configure github strategy

```js
// app.js
passport.use(new GithubStrategy({
  clientID: 'your app client id',
  clientSecret: 'your app client secret',
  callbackURL: 'http://localhost:3000/auth/callback'
}, function(accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done){
  done(null, {
    accessToken: accessToken,
    profile: profile
  });
}));
```

Github doen't have a `refreshToken` so we don't care about it. The object we passed to `done()` method will be received by `serializeUser`.

In order to maintain the users session,
Passport will serialize and deserialize `user` instances to and from the session. we need to configure those methods as our needs.

```js
// app.js
passport.serializeUser(function(user, done) {
  // for the time being tou can serialize the user 
  // object {accessToken: accessToken, profile: profile }
  // In the real app you might be storing on the id like user.profile.id 
  done(null, user);
});

passport.deserializeUser(function(user, done) {
  // If you are storing the whole user on session we can just pass to the done method, 
  // But if you are storing the user id you need to query your db and get the user 
  //object and pass to done() 
  done(null, user);
});
```
The `serializeUser` will store the user id in the session and `deserializeUser` will get the user from our database and store it in `req.user`.

# Configure routes
We need to configure the routes for auth callback and error.

```js
// app.js
app.get('/auth', passport.authenticate('github'));
app.get('/auth/error', auth.error);
app.get('/auth/callback',
  passport.authenticate('github', {failureRedirect: '/auth/error'}),
  auth.callback
);
```

The implementation of the routes are upto you.

```js
// routes/auth.js
exports.callback = function(req, res){
  // In the real application you might need to check 
  // whether the user exits and if exists redirect 
  // or if not you many need to create user.
  res.send('Login success');
};

exports.error = function(req, res){
  res.send('Login Failed');
};
```
Thats it, you successfully implemented the github authentication for you express.js app with passport. In this I just skipped the usage of models and store the data to make it short. Consider this as a steeping stone and if you have any issues on implementing this in a real app, lemme know via comments. I will try my best to address it.

Until next time.  
Thank you.
